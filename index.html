        <p class="section-content">More than 50 research students have been supported by my federal grants in the last five years, and I encourage networking
          among my students and with many other students and colleagues. My research students have gone on to successful careers
          in fields ranging from plant breeding informatics to biostatistics to high-school science teaching. Career mentoring
          and training in project management is a key part of my student mentoring strategy.</p>

                I’m in the middle of the 2nd year in the Immunobiology PhD program at University of Arizona- and I am absolutely loving it!
                I remind myself quite often how lucky I am to have the opportunity to further my education here and I know
                I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for you. I really appreciate you allowing me to work in your lab and providing
                me with guidance when I applied for school. I just wanted to touch base with you and say thanks for being a
                great mentor and taking the time to help us confused students!

                Being a new college student, I don’t think I was ready for the challenge of honors biology. It was a daunting challenge,
                but I know now that it really prepared me for my future classes. I’m taking a genetics class this semester,
                and I think it’s because of taking Honors Bio 201 that I am having an easier time than some of my other classmates.
                I just wanted to thank you for challenging me and preparing me for future classes because I don’t think I appreciated
                it at this time a year and a half ago.

                As my undergrad experience comes to an end I wanted to that you for all the initial effort you put into my education. From
                the thought provoking Honors Bio201 class to helping my find a lab that conducted research I liked, and everything
                in between…I really appreciated it.

                Thank you so much for serving on my honors committee, but even more, thank you for your constant guidance throughout my undergraduate
                career. I can honestly say that I would not be where I am without your expertise and kindness. Thank you for
                believing in me when I didn’t believe in me. Thank you for pushing us all to the limit in “Bio Bootcamp”. Thank
                you for never being too busy to help or talk. I feel truly honored to have had the opportunity to learn from
                you.

                You supported and guided me in my college career. You were my first biology professor. Your class was hard, but it prepared
                me for more difficult courses down the road. You were on my Honors project committee, and your advice was invaluable.

                I wanted to take a second to thank you from the bottom of my heart for the opportunity to be your student and work in your
                lab. I have grown immeasurably as a student and scientist during my time with you and have gained so many skills
                that I know I can take with me into the professional world and into graduate school. You have been a great
                mentor to me. Thank you again for all that you've done for me!

        </h1>
        <p class="section-content">
          This site was built by Onshore Studios, a website creation and design company run by two UNCW graduates.  We used the skills gained from our time at UNCW to start a website building and design business. Ethan, our administrator, graduated with an accounting degree from the Cameron school of business.  His knowledge of keeping financial records and managing clients and work orders is what keeps our business running smoothly, legally, and efficiently.  Andrew, our developer, graduated with a degree in Computer Science.  His coding and design ability is what creates our elegant sites and maintains high quality products for our customers. Andrew has experience in many programming languages, but primarily works as a Ruby on Rails devloper for N2 Publishing. This shows you should not take the lessons you learn at UNCW for granted because one day you could be running your own business as well.
